Certainly! Below are examples illustrating those principles with respect to `software.amazon.awssdk.services.kinesis`:

**1. One assert per test & Test one thing at a time**

When testing a `PutRecordRequest`, you want to make sure that each test focuses on a single attribute of the request.

```java
@Test
public void testPartitionKeySetting() {
    PutRecordRequest request = PutRecordRequest.builder()
                                               .partitionKey("myPartitionKey")
                                               .build();

    assertEquals("myPartitionKey", request.partitionKey());
}

@Test
public void testDataSetting() {
    SdkBytes data = SdkBytes.fromUtf8String("someData");
    PutRecordRequest request = PutRecordRequest.builder()
                                               .data(data)
                                               .build();

    assertEquals(data, request.data());
}
```

**2. More than one test per unit**

The `KinesisClient` can be mocked to test the behavior of a unit that interacts with it. For instance, let's test a simple producer that pushes data to Kinesis:

```java
public class SimpleProducer {
    private final KinesisClient kinesisClient;

    public SimpleProducer(KinesisClient kinesisClient) {
        this.kinesisClient = kinesisClient;
    }

    public void sendData(String data) {
        kinesisClient.putRecord(PutRecordRequest.builder()
                                                .data(SdkBytes.fromUtf8String(data))
                                                .partitionKey("someKey")
                                                .streamName("myStream")
                                                .build());
    }
}
```

Now, you can write multiple tests for this `SimpleProducer`:

```java
@Test
public void testSendDataCallsPutRecord() {
    KinesisClient mockClient = mock(KinesisClient.class);
    SimpleProducer producer = new SimpleProducer(mockClient);
    
    producer.sendData("testData");

    verify(mockClient).putRecord(any(PutRecordRequest.class));
}

@Test
public void testSendDataUsesCorrectStream() {
    // ...
}
```

**3. No hardcoded values, unless it has specific meaning**

Use constants or parameterized tests:

```java
private static final String TEST_STREAM_NAME = "myStream";

@Test
public void testStreamNameSetting() {
    PutRecordRequest request = PutRecordRequest.builder()
                                               .streamName(TEST_STREAM_NAME)
                                               .build();

    assertEquals(TEST_STREAM_NAME, request.streamName());
}
```

**4. No retention or manipulation of state**

Ensure that tests do not depend on any shared state:

```java
@BeforeEach
public void setup() {
    // Set up fresh state for each test
}
```

**Happy Path Test**:

```java
@Test
public void testPutRecordHappyPath() {
    KinesisClient mockClient = mock(KinesisClient.class);
    when(mockClient.putRecord(any())).thenReturn(PutRecordResponse.builder().sequenceNumber("12345").build());

    SimpleProducer producer = new SimpleProducer(mockClient);
    producer.sendData("testData");

    verify(mockClient).putRecord(any(PutRecordRequest.class));
}
```

**Unhappy Path Test**:

```java
@Test
public void testPutRecordFailure() {
    KinesisClient mockClient = mock(KinesisClient.class);
    when(mockClient.putRecord(any())).thenThrow(KinesisException.builder().message("Error occurred").build());

    SimpleProducer producer = new SimpleProducer(mockClient);

    assertThrows(KinesisException.class, () -> producer.sendData("testData"));
}
```

In these examples, the `mock()` and related methods are from the Mockito framework, which is widely used in the Java ecosystem for creating mock objects in unit tests. Remember to include necessary dependencies when trying to use Mockito or any other testing frameworks.



```java
public class SimpleProducer {
    private final KinesisClient kinesisClient;

    public SimpleProducer(KinesisClient kinesisClient) {
        this.kinesisClient = kinesisClient;
    }

    public void sendData(String data) {
        if (data.matches("-?\\d+")) { // regex check for integers
            throw new IllegalArgumentException("Integers are not allowed as data.");
        }
        kinesisClient.putRecord(PutRecordRequest.builder()
                                                .data(SdkBytes.fromUtf8String(data))
                                                .partitionKey("someKey")
                                                .streamName("myStream")
                                                .build());
    }
}

```

In the above code, there is a a check using a regex pattern (-?\\d+) to identify if the provided string is an integer (negative or positive). If an integer is detected, an IllegalArgumentException is thrown.

```java
@Test
public void testSendDataThrowsExceptionOnIntInput() {
    KinesisClient mockClient = mock(KinesisClient.class);

    SimpleProducer producer = new SimpleProducer(mockClient);

    assertThrows(IllegalArgumentException.class, () -> producer.sendData("12345"));
}

```


## Edge Case: Sending a Record with a Maximum Allowed Size

Kinesis has a maximum size limit for each record you send (at the time of my last update, this was 1 MB for a single record). An edge case test would involve trying to send a record of exactly that size and ensuring it's handled correctly.  


```java
@Test
public void testSendMaxSizeRecord() {
    KinesisClient mockClient = mock(KinesisClient.class);
    SimpleProducer producer = new SimpleProducer(mockClient);

    // Creating a data string that's very close to the limit.
    // Note: This is a naive way; the real size includes more than just the data due to 
    // metadata and other parts of the request, but for the sake of this example, it works.
    byte[] almostMaxSizeData = new byte[(1024 * 1024) - 1]; // 1 MB minus 1 byte
    Arrays.fill(almostMaxSizeData, (byte) 'A');
    String testData = new String(almostMaxSizeData, StandardCharsets.UTF_8);

    producer.sendData(testData);

    // Verify that the mockClient's putRecord method was called with our large data
    verify(mockClient).putRecord(argThat(request -> 
        Arrays.equals(request.data().asByteArray(), almostMaxSizeData)
    ));
}

```

This test checks whether the producer can handle sending a record that's very close to the maximum size limit. Depending on how SimpleProducer and KinesisClient are implemented, this could help catch issues related to buffering, memory management, or request handling.




Below is a table of mock tests (often referred to as "smoke tests") for the `software.amazon.awssdk.services.kinesis`. This table will outline high-level test scenarios you might run into with `Kinesis`. These tests are more on the functional/integration testing side, but they're critical initial tests to verify basic functionality.

Note: These test scenarios are just hypothetical for the purpose of illustrating the table's structure. The "ACTUAL RESULT" and "STATUS" columns would be filled in during or after test execution.

| TI.ID | TEST SCENARIOS                          | DESCRIPTION                                                         | TEST STEP                                                                   | EXPECTED RESULT                            | ACTUAL RESULT | STATUS |
|-------|----------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|----------------|--------|
| 001   | Put Record Success                      | Verify that a record can be put into a Kinesis stream.              | 1. Create `PutRecordRequest`. <br> 2. Call `putRecord` on `KinesisClient`. | Record is accepted and sequence number returned. |                |        |
| 002   | Get Record Success                      | Fetch a record from Kinesis stream.                                 | 1. Put a record into the stream. <br> 2. Retrieve record using `getRecord`.  | Record data matches the data that was put into the stream. | |        |
| 003   | Handle Oversized Record                 | Ensure that records exceeding the size limit are handled correctly. | 1. Create an oversized `PutRecordRequest`. <br> 2. Call `putRecord`.        | Receive an error indicating that the record is too large. |                |        |
| 004   | Invalid Stream Name                     | Use an invalid stream name and ensure the error is captured.        | 1. Create `PutRecordRequest` with invalid stream name. <br> 2. Call `putRecord`. | Receive an error indicating invalid stream name. |                |        |
| 005   | Put Record with No Data                 | Try to send a record without any data.                              | 1. Create `PutRecordRequest` without data. <br> 2. Call `putRecord`.       | Receive an error indicating missing data.   |                |        |
| 006   | Create and Delete Stream                | Test the creation and deletion of a Kinesis stream.                 | 1. Call `createStream`. <br> 2. Call `deleteStream`.                       | Stream is created and then successfully deleted. |                |        |

This table is a high-level representation. In real testing scenarios, you'd likely have more detailed test steps, prerequisites, postconditions, etc. Also, while these tests can be run against a real environment, in the context of "smock" or "smoke" tests, you might want to have a mock or stubbed version of the `KinesisClient` to speed up the execution and avoid costs or side effects.
