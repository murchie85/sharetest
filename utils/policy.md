For each of the identified failure scenarios, consider the following mitigation strategies:

Redundancy: Implement redundant systems and components to ensure high availability.
Monitoring: Use comprehensive monitoring tools to detect and alert on potential issues before they escalate.
Regular Backups: Perform regular backups and ensure that restore processes are tested and reliable.
Disaster Recovery Planning: Develop and regularly update disaster recovery plans, and conduct drills to ensure preparedness.
Patch Management: Implement a robust patch management process to keep systems up-to-date with the latest security and feature updates.
Access Controls: Enforce strict access controls and regularly audit permissions to minimize the risk of unauthorized access.
Documentation: Maintain thorough documentation of configurations, processes, and procedures to aid in troubleshooting and recovery.
