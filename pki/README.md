# MORE GENERAL PKI INTERVIEW questions

Certainly! Here's a list of interview questions about Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) and its technicalities, along with their answers:

**1. What is PKI?**
   *Answer:* PKI, or Public Key Infrastructure, is a combination of hardware, software, policies, and standards that work together to provide a framework for secure communications. It uses asymmetric cryptography to secure confidential data, authenticate users, and ensure data integrity.

**2. How does asymmetric cryptography work in PKI?**
   *Answer:* Asymmetric cryptography uses two keys: a public key, which can be shared openly, and a private key, which remains confidential. Data that's encrypted with the public key can only be decrypted with the corresponding private key, and vice versa.

**3. What are the main components of a PKI?**
   *Answer:* The main components of PKI include: 
   - Certificate Authority (CA): issues and revokes digital certificates.
   - Registration Authority (RA): verifies user requests for a digital certificate and tells the CA to issue it.
   - Central Directory: to store and index keys.
   - Digital Certificates: electronic documents that contain the public key.
   - Certificate Revocation List (CRL): a list of certificates that have been revoked before their expiration date.

**4. What is the purpose of a Digital Certificate?**
   *Answer:* A digital certificate serves as a digital ID for users and devices. It contains the public key and information about its owner. Certificates are issued by a CA and can be used to prove the identity of the certificate holder and provide a means to establish secure communications.

**5. What is a Certificate Revocation List (CRL)?**
   *Answer:* A CRL is a list of digital certificates that have been revoked by the issuing CA before their natural expiration date. This means that those certificates are no longer valid and should not be trusted.

**6. Explain the difference between a root certificate and an intermediate certificate.**
   *Answer:* A root certificate is the top-most certificate in a certificate chain, and it's issued by a top-level CA. An intermediate certificate is one that's issued by an intermediate CA, and it acts as a link between the root certificate and end-entity or leaf certificates. The use of intermediate CAs provides an additional layer of security by allowing the root private key to be kept offline.

**7. What is the role of the Registration Authority (RA) in PKI?**
   *Answer:* An RA acts as a verifier for the CA before the digital certificate is issued to the end user. It receives requests for digital certificates and verifies the individual's identity before the CA can issue the certificate.

**8. How does PKI support non-repudiation?**
   *Answer:* Non-repudiation ensures that a sender cannot deny sending a message and the receiver cannot deny receiving it. PKI supports non-repudiation by using digital signatures. When a message is signed with a user's private key, anyone can verify the message's origin and integrity with the corresponding public key, ensuring the message was not tampered with and was indeed sent by the claimed sender.

**9. What is a key pair in PKI?**
   *Answer:* A key pair refers to the public and private keys used in asymmetric cryptography. These keys are mathematically related. Data encrypted with one key can only be decrypted with the other key.

**10. How are keys stored securely in a PKI system?**
   *Answer:* Keys are stored securely using hardware security modules (HSMs), secure key storage software, or secure containers. These methods ensure the private keys are encrypted and are accessible only by authorized entities.

This should provide a solid foundation for an interview on PKI. Adjust the questions and depth based on the technical proficiency required for the role you're interviewing for.



Of course! Let's continue with more general questions on PKI before diving deeper into technical ones.

**General PKI Questions:**

**11. What is the difference between symmetric and asymmetric encryption?**
   *Answer:* Symmetric encryption uses a single key for both encryption and decryption, meaning both parties must share this key securely. Asymmetric encryption, on the other hand, uses a pair of keys (public and private). The public key is used for encryption, while the corresponding private key is used for decryption.

**12. Why is key management essential in PKI?**
   *Answer:* Key management ensures the generation, distribution, storage, rotation, and disposal of keys in a secure manner. Poor key management can lead to unauthorized access or the inability to decrypt critical data, thereby compromising the entire PKI system's integrity and purpose.

**13. What are wildcard certificates?**
   *Answer:* Wildcard certificates are SSL certificates that can be used with multiple sub-domains of a domain. For instance, a wildcard certificate for `*.example.com` could be used for `mail.example.com`, `shop.example.com`, etc.

**14. What is a certificate chain or certification path?**
   *Answer:* A certificate chain is a series of certificates used to authenticate an entity. It starts from the end-entity certificate, through one or more intermediate certificates, and ends with the root certificate.

**15. What is meant by "certificate pinning"?**
   *Answer:* Certificate pinning involves hardcoding the fingerprint of a certificate or public key within an application. It ensures that the app can only communicate with the designated server, providing an additional layer of security against man-in-the-middle attacks, even if the certificate authority gets compromised.

**In-Depth Technical PKI Questions:**

**16. How does the Diffie-Hellman key exchange complement PKI?**
   *Answer:* Diffie-Hellman is a method of securely exchanging cryptographic keys over a public channel. In PKI, it can be used alongside digital certificates to establish a shared secret between two parties without ever transmitting the secret itself.

**17. What cryptographic algorithms are commonly used in PKI systems?**
   *Answer:* RSA, DSA, and ECC (Elliptic Curve Cryptography) are popular algorithms used in PKI. RSA and DSA are used for digital signatures and key transport, while ECC is becoming popular due to its ability to provide the same security as RSA/DSA with shorter key lengths.

**18. How does OCSP (Online Certificate Status Protocol) improve upon CRLs?**
   *Answer:* OCSP allows applications to query the status of a specific certificate in real-time. Instead of downloading potentially large CRLs periodically, systems can use OCSP to check the revocation status of a certificate on-the-fly, providing more timely and efficient checks.

**19. What's the role of a nonce in a cryptographic protocol, and why is it important?**
   *Answer:* A nonce is a random or semi-random number that's used only once in a cryptographic protocol. It helps prevent replay attacks, where an attacker might capture a valid encrypted message and resend it, tricking systems into thinking it's a new, legitimate request.

**20. How do hardware security modules (HSMs) play a role in PKI?**
   *Answer:* HSMs are physical devices that safeguard and manage digital keys, offering a secure environment for cryptographic operations. In PKI, they ensure that private keys are generated, stored, and used in a highly secure environment, resistant to both logical and physical attacks.

These questions should provide a comprehensive overview of PKI for an interviewee, from basic understanding to more technical aspects.


Certainly! I understand the stakes are high when you're being interviewed by an expert. Let's dive deeper into the PKI architecture and then shift to the web side and system-related topics.

**In-depth PKI Architecture Questions:**

**21. How is a hierarchical PKI architecture structured, and why is it favored?**
   *Answer:* Hierarchical PKI is structured in a tree format with the root CA at the top. Below the root are intermediate or issuing CAs, which can further have other intermediate CAs or end-entity certificates. This structure brings trust delegation, reduces the risk by keeping the root CA offline, and offers scalability and easier management.

**22. What are the potential risks associated with a flat PKI architecture?**
   *Answer:* In a flat architecture, the CA directly signs end-entity certificates. Risks include compromise of the single CA affecting all issued certificates, limited scalability, and a potential for slower certificate issuance and revocation processes due to a single point of processing.

**23. How does a cross-certification in PKI work, and in what scenarios is it used?**
   *Answer:* Cross-certification is when two CAs issue certificates for each other, allowing users in one PKI to trust users in another PKI. It's used in scenarios where distinct organizations or entities want to establish trust without being in the same hierarchical PKI.

**24. What role does a Policy Authority (PA) play in a PKI?**
   *Answer:* A PA is responsible for defining and updating the certificate policy, which outlines the purpose of the certificate, application, and the rules governing the PKI.

**25. How are PKI private keys typically protected during storage and use?**
   *Answer:* PKI private keys are protected using encryption when stored. During use, keys might reside in memory temporarily, but best practices involve using secure cryptographic processors or Hardware Security Modules (HSMs) to handle key operations without exposing the key.

**Web Side and System Questions:**

**26. What is the significance of the DNS (Domain Name System) in the web infrastructure?**
   *Answer:* DNS translates user-friendly domain names, like www.example.com, into IP addresses, facilitating user navigation and ensuring the correct servers are reached.

**27. Can you explain the difference between an A record and a CNAME record in DNS?**
   *Answer:* An A record maps a domain name directly to an IP address. A CNAME record, on the other hand, maps a domain or subdomain to another domain name, effectively redirecting it.

**28. How does an SSL/TLS handshake work?**
   *Answer:* The SSL/TLS handshake is a series of steps: 
1. ClientHello: Client sends supported cryptographic algorithms.
2. ServerHello: Server picks algorithms from client's list.
3. Server sends its certificate and may request the client's.
4. Key exchange and generation of pre-master secret.
5. Both derive a master secret from the pre-master secret.
6. Verification to confirm successful secret generation.
7. Secure communication begins using the agreed-upon secret.

**29. What are the potential issues with using wildcard certificates?**
   *Answer:* While convenient, wildcard certificates can present security risks. If a server or subdomain with the wildcard certificate is compromised, all subdomains are potentially at risk. It can also mask misconfigurations or unauthorized subdomains.

**30. How does Keyfactor play a role in PKI management?**
   *Answer:* Keyfactor provides end-to-end secure identity solutions, including managing the entire lifecycle of digital certificates. It aids in automating the process of certificate issuance, renewal, and revocation, ensures proper key management, and helps maintain compliance and governance standards.

When preparing for your interview, besides knowing the answers, make sure to understand the underlying concepts and mechanisms, as experts often appreciate depth and a solid grasp of fundamentals.
